Traffic Light System
Overview
This project is a 4-way traffic light control system built with an Arduino. It operates in two modes: automatic and manual. In automatic mode, the traffic lights cycle through green, yellow, and red at timed intervals for each intersection. In manual mode, the user can manually control the light transitions, with a blue LED indicating the active mode.

How to Use
Automatic Mode: The system will automatically manage the traffic lights, cycling through green, yellow, and red. The green light will flash three times before switching to yellow.

Manual Mode: Press the mode button to switch to manual mode. In this mode, you can manually control which intersection displays the green light by pressing the manual button. The yellow light will blink for one second before changing the signal.

Mode Indicator: A blue LED shows the current mode:

Manual Mode: ON
Automatic Mode: OFF
